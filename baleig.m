% Performs two-sided scaling Dl\A*Dr, Dl\B*Dr in order to improve
% the sensitivity of generalized eigenvalues. The diagonal matrices
% Dl and Dr are constrained to powers of 2 and are computed iteratively
% until the number of iterations max_iter is met or until the norms are
% between 1/2 and 2. Convergence is often reached after 2 or 3 steps.
% The diagonals of the scaling matrices are returned in Dl and Dr
% and so is iter, the number of iterations steps used by the method.
